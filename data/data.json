Small, locally owned, and eager to please, businesses like Sharetea improve neighborhoods and support the community by selling local crafts and serving a high quality product. I will admit that when I initially saw my acai bowl that I thought it was pretty small for the money, especially since I ordered the \"large\" size for $11. Heres the thing, this acai bowl is DENSE. The acai wasnt loose and melty, the toppings were proportionate, and I finished my bowl feeling very satisfied. Dare I say full? Im very grateful to have a place like this in my neighborhood and will certainly be supporting. See you soon, Sharetea!",

Its the same menu as offered throughout the Sharetea chain. Unfortunately, parking in this narrow strip mall is just as bad as the shop on Convoy Street if not arguably worse because every space is so tightly packed.I usually get one of their fruit teas (Passion Fruit Green Tea or Hawaiian Fruit Tea with Aiju Jelly) which range in price from $4.25 to $4.50. Add another $0.75 for boba pearls and youre above the $5 mark after tax. The size of the drink and quality of the tea were pretty reasonable. The chewiness of the pearls was not quite up to the level of my favorite hangouts though.One aspect which I did find incredibly annoying is the $0.50 surcharge if you requested less ice for your drink. That used to not be the case when they first opened. I am not aware of another bubble tea shop that has such a policy either. I also dont understand why the boba cost is 50% more than elsewhere. On the other hand, this spot offers a frequent user card which is a bonus because the one in Kearny Mesa no longer does.",

They have a seating area, bar stools and a sizable bar. I opt for the lemon black tea with no sugar and aloe jelly. There was only one size to choose from which is (im guessing) a 16 oz. I started to read the signs near the register and there is pretty much a up charge for EVERYTHING. If you want less ice, up charge, more of anything less of anything theres up charges, which is a little odd. But thats their policy.Our orders were ready within in minutes, Ive had a lemon black tea from SOO many places but ShareTeas was VERY sour.

I am a fan of chewier boba, not the type that just disintegrates in your mouth. So the drinks here are great and I highly recommend them. The service however could use some work... I used to work in a boba shop so I can give my order rather quickly and hit all the parts I need to address (ice, sweetness, toppings, milk type, etc). Most places can keep up, but here you need to slow down and spell it out... then double check that they did it right. Twice, Ive ordered slowly and still noticed mistakes on the receipt after reiterating my order. They also have recently gotten rid of their size options and only offer 1 size, but just upcharge your drink to a large to compensate in their system. Kinda sucks when your drink costs 60 cents more than anticipated, and when you and your friend still get different sized cups after both being charged extra.

We also tried the coffee milk tea at 80% still a bit sweet.. but also refreshing.Hubster picked up the order that i placed online and drinks were ready quickly and without issue. Definitely will be back to try more!",

It tasted like 25% and made me really sad. I could tell the flavor was good tho, so i wouldve really liked it more if it was sweeter-passion fruit mango tea: really liked the flavor of this n there was small chunks of fruit in it. got this at 50% sweetness and it was super sweet?-bamboo charcoal: i believe i got this before at 50% sweetness and it was the perfect sweetness. I really liked how it tasted but it was just so heavy, thick, and creamy. I love charcoal stuff but think this got overwhelming-kumquat tea: got this at 50% sweetness and it was super sweet, really liked the flavor tho",

Also, aiyu jelly - I usually like the kind where its a large chunk that when I sip on it it breaks up - the one they use already seems like its broken up so the texture isnt my fave.SERVICE: attentive staff, reasonable wait time, drinks are prepared quickly.

My only complaint is we got both drinks with aloe Vera and the aloe Vera is slimy and weird. Like slimy slimy. I like aloe Vera for the crunch so this was just extremely off putting to me.

It has pulp from the fruit, aloe, and is a great balance between tarty and sweet.The Strawberry Fresh Milk tastes like a great mix of strawberry, ice, and condensed milk. It is a familiar taste to my childhood and something my mom would make. My husband says it tastes like ice cream haha.",

Its seasonal because they use real peaches, and you can definitely tell when you taste the tea. It is so fresh, juicy, and delightful. I hate that fake artificial peach taste, but this is the real deal.I also tried the Pink Beauty. Im not entirely sure what this entire grapefruit drink is made of, but it tastes like lemon + grapegruit + ai-yu which is included in the drink. It is definitely refreshing, and it is a customer favorite. I added boba, which was kind of a mistake because the boba flavor detracts from the light fruity flavor of the drink. Ai-yu is a soft jelly that comes in big blobs. My friends really like this drink. For me, it was alright, maybe slightly above average, haha. I wish I could taste the tea flavor more.Next, I tried the orange green tea. Ive had better, such as the Sunright Fruit Tea or YiFang orange green tea (when it was on their menu). I personally prefer my orange green teas more pulpy and thick so it tastes more fresh, and this one very fine and thin. It is still refreshing, but I dont know if I would crave it and have to get it again.I would definitely come back for the peach green tea! I will need to explore other menu items to find other gems :)",

They would called us pretty much right after we placed the order and switched to something else, but I dont understand why they couldnt just take the unavailable drink off from the online menu or mark as unavailable. Nevertheless, the drinks are super good and refreshing especially the fruit teas. My favorites are Jade lemon tea, fruit tea and pink lady. Im a fan and will definitely keep coming back!",

This time, I got the Strawberry Beauty because a friend recommended it to me. It was pretty good! It had a good fruity taste with both sweet and sour flavors. Reminded me of a strawberry lemonade but more strawberry flavor and bits.

I got the Creme Br\u00fbl\u00e9e Match (5/5). Highly recommend if you like sweet and creamy drinks. I personally loved it as I like my drinks to be on the sweeter end and this definitely delivered! My girlfriend got their #1 bestseller, Superfruit Tea (5/5) and she also loved it! Its tea with a combination of mixed fruits (orange, lime, lemon, strawberry, passionfruit, and peach(?)) You can definitely taste the tea and it was the perfect sweetness for her. Great if youre looking for a refreshing drink on a hot day. We also were very intrigued by their tea jelly. Its made in house and you can get as as a topping in your drinks or on the side (what we did) with a topping. It was also very delicious! I never expect customer service from boba spots but the customer service here was superb. Shout out to the guy who helped us answer so many questions! This place is definitely underrated and is better than most chained boba spots that only offer basic milk teas and syrup flavored teas. A must try!",

I ordered the Ruby MT (first time Ive heard of it) and they compared it to a black tea which is stronger than Ceylon MT. I got it 50% sweet with no ice so that I could taste more of the tea flavor, but alas it just tasted like....slightly sweeter milk water? Really neutral. No roasted, robust, creamy, floral or nutty flavor one way or the other. Im hoping I just ordered the wrong drink and that the quality is better it I ever come around next time. Cute aesthetic and drinks. reminds me of OMOMO back in Irvine - however the flavor isnt up to par with them (the price is tho)",

They take a whole orange and blend it in with tea, super refreshing.The fianc\u00e9 got the Ruby Milk Tea. He would definitely recommend doing the Ruby version for milk tea. For milk teas, they offer milk substitutes which is great for us. We got it with soy last time.While we were sitting down with our boba, I love how clean this place is. When the employees are not tending to orders, they are constantly cleaning and sanitizing things. I really appreciate that extra care, especially during these times.

Tiramisu with oolong milk tea is the one we tried and its so so good. Flavor is creamy but you still can taste the oolong and not overpowering, sweetness is also the right amount. $4.85 plus tax.

You can get the Stormy drinks in several different flavors, with some of my favorites being the Taro, Mango and my absolute #1 - the Honeydew! And you know how at some places (that shall remain nameless), you get an ice blended drink but they dont blend it well enough that you start sipping on ice chunks? Well not here.

But then we mixed it up and it tasted so much better. The boba was nice, fresh, and soft with a good chew to it. The Honeydew Stormy is an ice blended drink. We really enjoyed that one and it was very refreshing. No fake honeydew taste like we have had at other places. Both drinks ended up being great and full of flavor.

There are definitely a lot of good options but R&amp;B Tea has some standout drinks to set them apart from the other spots. Specifically, their Stormy series of drinks are a must have if you go here. The Stormy drinks are ice-blended drinks and they also mix in this creamy mixture into the drink that makes it so darn good. You can get the Stormy drinks in several different flavors, with some of my favorites being the Taro, Mango and my absolute #1 - the Honeydew! And you know how at some places (that shall remain nameless), you get an ice blended drink but they dont blend it well enough that you start sipping on ice chunks? Well not here. They have gotten it perfectly blended every time, which makes it so easy to drink. In fact, my only complaint is that its so easy to drink that the one-size drink makes me want it an extra-large cup! So. Good.",
