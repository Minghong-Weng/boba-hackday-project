Small, locally owned, and eager to please, businesses like Sharetea improve neighborhoods and support the community by selling local crafts and serving a high quality product. I will admit that when I initially saw my acai bowl that I thought it was pretty small for the money, especially since I ordered the \"large\" size for $11. Heres the thing, this acai bowl is DENSE. The acai wasnt loose and melty, the toppings were proportionate, and I finished my bowl feeling very satisfied. Dare I say full? Im very grateful to have a place like this in my neighborhood and will certainly be supporting. See you soon, Sharetea!",

Its the same menu as offered throughout the Sharetea chain. Unfortunately, parking in this narrow strip mall is just as bad as the shop on Convoy Street if not arguably worse because every space is so tightly packed.I usually get one of their fruit teas (Passion Fruit Green Tea or Hawaiian Fruit Tea with Aiju Jelly) which range in price from $4.25 to $4.50. Add another $0.75 for boba pearls and youre above the $5 mark after tax. The size of the drink and quality of the tea were pretty reasonable. The chewiness of the pearls was not quite up to the level of my favorite hangouts though.One aspect which I did find incredibly annoying is the $0.50 surcharge if you requested less ice for your drink. That used to not be the case when they first opened. I am not aware of another bubble tea shop that has such a policy either. I also dont understand why the boba cost is 50% more than elsewhere. On the other hand, this spot offers a frequent user card which is a bonus because the one in Kearny Mesa no longer does.",

They have a seating area, bar stools and a sizable bar. I opt for the lemon black tea with no sugar and aloe jelly. There was only one size to choose from which is (im guessing) a 16 oz. I started to read the signs near the register and there is pretty much a up charge for EVERYTHING. If you want less ice, up charge, more of anything less of anything theres up charges, which is a little odd. But thats their policy.Our orders were ready within in minutes, Ive had a lemon black tea from SOO many places but ShareTeas was VERY sour.

I am a fan of chewier boba, not the type that just disintegrates in your mouth. So the drinks here are great and I highly recommend them. The service however could use some work... I used to work in a boba shop so I can give my order rather quickly and hit all the parts I need to address (ice, sweetness, toppings, milk type, etc). Most places can keep up, but here you need to slow down and spell it out... then double check that they did it right. Twice, Ive ordered slowly and still noticed mistakes on the receipt after reiterating my order. They also have recently gotten rid of their size options and only offer 1 size, but just upcharge your drink to a large to compensate in their system. Kinda sucks when your drink costs 60 cents more than anticipated, and when you and your friend still get different sized cups after both being charged extra.

We also tried the coffee milk tea at 80% still a bit sweet.. but also refreshing.Hubster picked up the order that i placed online and drinks were ready quickly and without issue. Definitely will be back to try more!",

It tasted like 25% and made me really sad. I could tell the flavor was good tho, so i wouldve really liked it more if it was sweeter-passion fruit mango tea: really liked the flavor of this n there was small chunks of fruit in it. got this at 50% sweetness and it was super sweet?-bamboo charcoal: i believe i got this before at 50% sweetness and it was the perfect sweetness. I really liked how it tasted but it was just so heavy, thick, and creamy. I love charcoal stuff but think this got overwhelming-kumquat tea: got this at 50% sweetness and it was super sweet, really liked the flavor tho",

Also, aiyu jelly - I usually like the kind where its a large chunk that when I sip on it it breaks up - the one they use already seems like its broken up so the texture isnt my fave.SERVICE: attentive staff, reasonable wait time, drinks are prepared quickly.

My only complaint is we got both drinks with aloe Vera and the aloe Vera is slimy and weird. Like slimy slimy. I like aloe Vera for the crunch so this was just extremely off putting to me.

It has pulp from the fruit, aloe, and is a great balance between tarty and sweet.The Strawberry Fresh Milk tastes like a great mix of strawberry, ice, and condensed milk. It is a familiar taste to my childhood and something my mom would make. My husband says it tastes like ice cream haha.",

Its seasonal because they use real peaches, and you can definitely tell when you taste the tea. It is so fresh, juicy, and delightful. I hate that fake artificial peach taste, but this is the real deal.I also tried the Pink Beauty. Im not entirely sure what this entire grapefruit drink is made of, but it tastes like lemon + grapegruit + ai-yu which is included in the drink. It is definitely refreshing, and it is a customer favorite. I added boba, which was kind of a mistake because the boba flavor detracts from the light fruity flavor of the drink. Ai-yu is a soft jelly that comes in big blobs. My friends really like this drink. For me, it was alright, maybe slightly above average, haha. I wish I could taste the tea flavor more.Next, I tried the orange green tea. Ive had better, such as the Sunright Fruit Tea or YiFang orange green tea (when it was on their menu). I personally prefer my orange green teas more pulpy and thick so it tastes more fresh, and this one very fine and thin. It is still refreshing, but I dont know if I would crave it and have to get it again.I would definitely come back for the peach green tea! I will need to explore other menu items to find other gems :)",

They would called us pretty much right after we placed the order and switched to something else, but I dont understand why they couldnt just take the unavailable drink off from the online menu or mark as unavailable. Nevertheless, the drinks are super good and refreshing especially the fruit teas. My favorites are Jade lemon tea, fruit tea and pink lady. Im a fan and will definitely keep coming back!",

This time, I got the Strawberry Beauty because a friend recommended it to me. It was pretty good! It had a good fruity taste with both sweet and sour flavors. Reminded me of a strawberry lemonade but more strawberry flavor and bits.

I got the Creme Br\u00fbl\u00e9e Match (5/5). Highly recommend if you like sweet and creamy drinks. I personally loved it as I like my drinks to be on the sweeter end and this definitely delivered! My girlfriend got their #1 bestseller, Superfruit Tea (5/5) and she also loved it! Its tea with a combination of mixed fruits (orange, lime, lemon, strawberry, passionfruit, and peach(?)) You can definitely taste the tea and it was the perfect sweetness for her. Great if youre looking for a refreshing drink on a hot day. We also were very intrigued by their tea jelly. Its made in house and you can get as as a topping in your drinks or on the side (what we did) with a topping. It was also very delicious! I never expect customer service from boba spots but the customer service here was superb. Shout out to the guy who helped us answer so many questions! This place is definitely underrated and is better than most chained boba spots that only offer basic milk teas and syrup flavored teas. A must try!",

I ordered the Ruby MT (first time Ive heard of it) and they compared it to a black tea which is stronger than Ceylon MT. I got it 50% sweet with no ice so that I could taste more of the tea flavor, but alas it just tasted like....slightly sweeter milk water? Really neutral. No roasted, robust, creamy, floral or nutty flavor one way or the other. Im hoping I just ordered the wrong drink and that the quality is better it I ever come around next time. Cute aesthetic and drinks. reminds me of OMOMO back in Irvine - however the flavor isnt up to par with them (the price is tho)",

They take a whole orange and blend it in with tea, super refreshing.The fianc\u00e9 got the Ruby Milk Tea. He would definitely recommend doing the Ruby version for milk tea. For milk teas, they offer milk substitutes which is great for us. We got it with soy last time.While we were sitting down with our boba, I love how clean this place is. When the employees are not tending to orders, they are constantly cleaning and sanitizing things. I really appreciate that extra care, especially during these times.

Tiramisu with oolong milk tea is the one we tried and its so so good. Flavor is creamy but you still can taste the oolong and not overpowering, sweetness is also the right amount. $4.85 plus tax.

You can get the Stormy drinks in several different flavors, with some of my favorites being the Taro, Mango and my absolute #1 - the Honeydew! And you know how at some places (that shall remain nameless), you get an ice blended drink but they dont blend it well enough that you start sipping on ice chunks? Well not here.

It can be a challenge parking in the lot with the surrounding busy streets and all the cars driving in, out, and around. If you cannot find a spot in the lot, you will need to go searching for other nearby lots or street parking. The staff was friendly and our drinks were made quickly. The menu has a variety of drinks such as teas, milks, milk teas, blended drinks, coffee. And there are several flavor options for each. You can also choose the ice and sweetness levels to your drinks. We ended up ordering two drinks - a Brown Sugar Boba Milk and a Honeydew Stormy. At first, we did not like the Brown Sugar much. But then we mixed it up and it tasted so much better. The boba was nice, fresh, and soft with a good chew to it. The Honeydew Stormy is an ice blended drink. We really enjoyed that one and it was very refreshing. No fake honeydew taste like we have had at other places. Both drinks ended up being great and full of flavor. The drinks come in sturdy cups which we appreciated. We will be back to try more!",

Im glad I did, since it was delicious! Their passionfruit tea was super fresh, and it was perfect at 25% sweetness. There were so many pineapple bits, and they were sweet and juicy. The aloe vera was really good, but I didnt need it with all the pineapple bits. For caffeine sensitive people, note that their teas are STRONG. I finished my rink around 2-2:30pm and still couldnt sleep until 24 hours later.My friend got their Hawaiian fruit tea and loved it, and it had giant pieces of fruit in it! I will definitely be back to try their Hawaiian fruit tea, milk teas (especially their cereal milk tea), and boba! All staff were wearing masks appropriately. Indoor seating is available, but no outdoor seating. Parking will be the most difficult part about coming here, since their shared lot is really small, and the spots are super squishy.",

The drink was yummmmyy, just the right amount of sweetness and consistency. The drink also has some sea salt cream which is a nice mixture with everything in the cup. As soon as I received the drink, I felt the warm boba at the bottom and the drink itself looked very pleasant.

Its a must try. Its delicious, frosty, creamy, and the taro doesnt taste too artificial or sweet. Its a fantastic balance of flavors and so refreshing on a hot day. Ive also tried their strawberry and mango matcha latte drinks, both of which were amazing. I normally dont enjoy matcha in my drinks but I think its perfectly balanced out in these drinks. It comes with a delicious sweet layer of fruit pur\u00e9e that isnt too sweet or artificial and they compliment the matcha so well. Theyre smooth, creamy, and satisfying. The only fruit tea of theirs Ive had is their passion fruit (which comes with aloe vera, big plus) and its really good, no complaints at all. It does come with seeds but theyre not too hard and they add a nice sour punch to the drink. Ive also had their Thai tea stormy, which I personally think isnt quite as good as the taro, but it is far from bad. Overall, R&amp;B has got their drinks down. I love the well rounded menu- not too large or small- and the atmosphere in the shop is great. Simple, pretty decor, with explosive flavorful unique drinks. Everyone should try this place at least once.",

I ordered takeout online because Convoy lacks parking. The downside is that you cant take advantage of the check in discount. Sunday at 3p there was plenty of parking in this small strip mall. I choose Mango Matcha Latte with their signature cream cheese, crystal and regular boba. I am beginning to prefer crystal boba but the latter makes for better pics and I kinda like the different consistencies as I chew. I also like being able to hold back some sugar and chose 50% sugar but next time I will try 25%. It was still sweet and still yummy. Very happy",

The price of the drinks was totally reasonable.Cons: It was crazy crowded and it was hard to find a place to wait that felt out of the way. It took forever to get our drinks. They dont really have fruit milk teas. I tried to order a peach milk tea and they said they dont do it because it separates. So bummed.

Before my lid was sealed, an employee read my cup \"do not blend\", looked at another employee, said \"oops\" and continued to seal the cup and give it to me anyways. I was literally standing right there at the pick up counter dude. I saw and heard the whole thing. I get it if it was a mistake and in that case, it would be cool. We all make mistakes. But you knew you made a mistake and you just didnt care. Now thats annoying. Time to find another go-to boba shop.",

They have a good variety of drinks from milk tea, punches, coffees, milk strikes, and just the standard teas. Their winter melon milk tea has always been my favorite and I like to try their seasonal specials as well. Their drinks are also a pretty good value compared to a lot of other shops in the area and I feel that you get a pretty solid tea for what you pay for; arguably the cheapest boba place that I know of for sure.

BORA BORA - peach oolong milk tea topped with butterfly pea flower tea. I am a lover of every element that makes up this drink. Any drink with butterfly pea flower always pulls on my heart strings. I didnt even bother to look at any other drink when this came to view. How do I describe this heavenly boba... it had the right amount of sweetness, with the light flavors of (in this order) milky-peach flavor, delicately tasted a refreshing herbal-ness of the oolong, and then a very subtle hint of butterfly pea flower. Fruity-herbal-woody. Each complimented and blended well together giving this perfect finesse combination that pleases your quench and crave for boba. And the honey boba just adds that playfulness when you sip BUT also can be a dodgeball game against your tonsil if you sip too much. Yah, I think Im obsessed. HIGHLY RECOMMEND.Until the next sip...Jaba Approved.",

It makes me a little sad that this pandemic wont allow us to enjoy our drinks in the ambience theyve created. ): Their menu has a great variety of drinks and food! They have a lot of unique drink options, and I seriously wanted to try them all.We tried the Rosie and the Winter Blossom and they didnt disappoint. All drinks are $5, but the amount they give makes it a great value.Will I return? Heck yes!Yelp 2021 Challenge: 02/40",

Also service was friendlyWe ordered Rosie, Starboy, and fried tofu. Starboy is a guava passionfruit mango tea and it was def our favorite!! It feels pretty unique and the guava flavor is super tasty. We got that at full sweetness and it was not overwhelmingly sweet (but less sweet prob wouldve been good too). Rosie is a watermelon green tea and it was pretty interesting with the toppings but not that watermelony to me. As for the fried tofu, ITS SOOOO GOOD!!! Super crispy n seasoned well. I love how all the snaccs are $6. Compared to tea station and tastea food, this seems more worth. I gotta come back and try more food and other cool drinks (they have a guava milk tea n durian milk tea n they sound very interesting)",

Ever since moving here Ive been searching far and wide for a milk tea shop since I moved to San Diego a month ago from the Bay Area where I frequented boba shops like teaspoon (all over the bay), tea island (Fremont), and TP tea (cupertino).You can really taste the tea flavor in the milk tea at camellia road. We tried the jasmine and genmaicha. Both I got \"less sweet\" and both were so delicious. The genmaicha is a green tea with toasted brown rice and it has almost a chocolatey taste. The jasmine wasnt too floral, and just the right combo of milk, sugar and tea. I cant thank this place enough to satisfy my milk tea fix. Just a little bummed its a 20 minute drive for me but well worth the distance!",

Their black tea was perfect, and very smooth and not at all bitter. The oat milk really rounded out the drink, and I loved their honey boba, which had a subtle sweetness and was nice and chewy. 25% sweet was perfect for me. I will definitely be back to try their Mango Green Tea and other drinks!No indoor seating is available, but there were a few tables and chairs set up for sitting outdoors. All staff were wearing masks properly. The best part about going to Camellia Rd Tea Bar is that they are located in the same plaza as Daiso, and you can make a quick Daiso run afterwards!

If you like tea, then youll taste how quality all of their drinks are. The Boba is always soft and chewy and warm, so I usually get it every single time.

This tea spot has several selections of milk teas ($5) and usually 2-3 monthly changing Fresca drinks ($4.50) with additional $0.50-$1 per addition (lactose free dairy, additional toppings). The menu is pretty straightforward. If you dont enjoy the strong tea flavors of tea, this place is not for you, unless you dont mind ordering a Fresca at a boba place. Frescas are very tasty as well. 1. Matcha is always good and I love it here! Possibly one of my favorite places to get matcha. 2. Hojicha reminds me of when I visited Japan, that roasted aroma. 3. Genmaicha I got with regular milk and it was pretty good as well. Not too sweet. 4. Scottish caramel with the hint of cacao sounded cool and I wanted to try it but sadly I did not enjoy. The chocolate tea flavor threw me off. It was not to my liking at all. I will stick to the original authentic teas. All the teas have their distinct authentic flavors and if youve never tried any one of the different kinds, try them and you may find your favorite/s! They also sell loose leaf teas for you to make in the comfort of your own home! This place most closely resembles the tea I had in Japan. I highly recommend this tea spot if you love tea!

As a tea collector, I can attest to the fact they brew their tea using whole leaves based on the sheer fragrance of the drinks. Some of the drinks that stand out to me are their oolong tea which uses Tieguanyin leaves (also known as Iron Goddess) which is quite rare because most places use roasted Dong ding oolong; the Tieguanyin imparts a more refreshing and floral characteristic to the tea. Their Puerh tea is also unique because no other place dares to make Puerh into milk tea because it is a very difficult flavor to tame, however Camelia found the perfect ripe Puerh that is made with sticky rice leaves to yield a beautiful drink that is calming and fragrant.

I tried the roasted oolong milk tea with boba and it was good, but not outstanding. Their honey boba was pretty standard as well. The drinks were made fairly quickly. Their featured dessert is what they call puffles. Its egg puffs (egg shaped waffles) with ice cream and lots of different toppings. You can choose one of their creations or you can build your own. We ordered a build your own with plain puffles (egg puffs), chocolate ice cream, oreo toppings, and chocolate drizzle. It was sweet, delicious, and very filling. I recommend eating this somewhat quickly, because after awhile, the puffles became soggy from the melted ice cream. This was our first time at Boba Bar and Desserts and it was a pretty good experience. We were the only customers at the time and service was fast and attentive. There was no seating or tables indoor or outdoors, but there was a small bench outside of the shop. I originally thought their milk tea menu only had five flavors of milk teas, but later found out they have another section of flavored milk teas, which is a little more extensive. They also have different teas, smoothies, slushies, Vietnamese coffee, brown sugar drinks, and salted cheese cream drinks. Boba Bar and Desserts is a good stop for boba and dessert in the Clairemont, Kearny Mesa area of SD, but for now its only to-go.",

I came here with my party after dinner across the street, and saw this was a super convenient boba shop. I ordered 3 drinks, a dragon fruit mango slush, honey mango slush, and a brown sugar marble. The total? Almost $25!!! Inflation may be rising, but this is a little too much...The dragon fruit and honey dew slushees were both of good quality, and tasted genuinely like each corresponding fruit. They all had good sugar levels and texture, and just overall a good experience. The honeydew slushy came topped with vanilla ice cream which I found odd, but was a nice addition! But, being a boba shop, youve gotta factor in their boba drinks. The brown sugar marble was a huge miss. Considering how its just milk and brown sugar boba, this drink was the absolute worst brown sugar milk tea Ive ever had. The marble is just some fancy name for a basic drink, and I would 100% dodge it. It was super watered down, its like how you add water to milk and drink it as milk. Yeah, a huge miss in my book. How the hell do you even mess up a BROWN SUGAR MT???The boba pearls had 0 taste on their own. They tasted like cold chewy balls, and added 0 substance as a drink. Its like throwing away $.50 down a sewer, an absolute embarrassment to boba. So yeah, huge yikes, especially when I can make better boba at home than this. They have really good smoothies though, and I cant say anything about their desserts. Just avoid their milk teas.",

It was like drinking a strawberry milk slush. 5/5 They also have fluffy pancakes. However keep in mind that they are only available after 5pm-closing and also takes much longer than the drinks to make. they are currently available at this time, except for Wednesdays.

                    "text": "UPDATE: Down to 3 stars because of the customer service I ended up receiving....I was a frequent customer here before, but not anymore. After telling the worker my order and having her verbalize the correct order back to me, I assumed all was good. However, I received the wrong drink. Turns out it was inputted incorrectly. Went up to see the wrong drink and when I asked about it, the worker said they always clarify the order on the screen and it is my fault that I did not catch it. This is true. I agree that it was completely my fault for not double checking the order. Now what was frustrating was how everything after that was handled. I have worked in customer service before in a restaurant and coffee shop. Lets face it, often times the customer is NOT always right. I admit this time I was wrong in not making sure the order was put correctly on the iPad. BUT, when we had customers say they received the wrong order although we knew they probably ordered incorrectly, if it does not take much time to replace the drink/food, we do it. Ultimately, we care about customer satisfaction, and want to make sure customers keep returning. But unfortunately this is not what happened. It was a bunch of explaining how wrong I was instead of trying to accommodate. So please, make sure you clarify on the iPad. Doesnt matter if you AND the worker both verbalize correctly. Otherwise theyre just going to make you feel so wrong and disappointed. I do not normally make bad reviews on customer service but this experience warranted one. Other places would be so accommodating if something was wrong and have no trouble just remaking a drink, so I cant help but to compare that to the bad service I experienced here. Im not docking down to just 1 star because I do want to give credit to the Top 1 drink: Royal Ceylon Mill Tea with Tiramisu. But this is really the only thing thats good. Again, this is just based on a customer service experience. I hate making customers feel like they dont want to come back so Im just writing this to make sure that doesnt happen again. ----------------------------------------------------My coworker introduced this to me one day and I knew I just had to come visit the store. First of all, I love how bright, clean, and inviting it is! Definitely has a great aesthetic.Drink wise:The menu is very easy to read, with drinks on two TVs and desserts (the fluffy pancakes) on another screen. I love how they include the top drinks on a separate drink, it made it easier to decide what to order. Speaking of top flavors, their #1 Top Drink: Royal Ceylon Milk Tea with Tiramisu is a MUST HAVE!!! I recommend getting it with caramel boba--in my opinion, its good quality boba, a good balance between soft and chewy. We also tried the #2 Top Drink: Uji Matcha with a Cheese Foam. Honestly, after trying the Tiramisu drink first, it made it hard to taste this one because of the sweetness of the former. Finally, another good one was the Br\u00fbl\u00e9e Green Tea with Oreo. However, we substituted the Oreo topping with caramel boba and this one was good if you prefer not having something as sweet as the Tiramisu. I think what makes this place even more unique is their stand their cute little shovels!!! Only thing is, I would suggest longer and sturdier shovels. Its easy to break and be careful for little ones because this could be a choking hazard. And having longer ones could prevent it from drowning in the drink. Food wise:I only tried the Creme Br\u00fbl\u00e9e pancake, and it was pretty good. I would go back and try the other ones.All in all, Ive enjoyed the service and how quick we get our orders. I rarely give 5 stars on dessert places and I think this one definitely deserves it. One of my new go-to boba joints!",

Plenty of parking in the shopping center. Basic menu, they have simple drinks. But the quality of the teas are wonderful. They can adjust sweetness and ice levels. They offer toppings for an extra fee. I really do love their cups! The cute heart stopper and the sip lid no need for straws! Plus if you dont finish your drink you can save it for the next day. The cups are reusable not sure how long it will last but it seems sturdy. Bring cash extra 5% off! Soft opening still happening as of 2/17/2020, buy one get one 50%! Overall clean well kept shop.

I love the tie guan yin drinks from TP tea in the bay area, so I figured I would try the one here since it is not a very frequently offered item on menus. Unfortunately, the tie guan yin milk tea here was not good. The tea flavor was not very strong and it tasted very watered down and diluted. It was nothing compared to TP tea and the staff also asked for feedback on it and did not offer to adjust the drink at all.

The interior is pretty empty and nothing to take photos with sadly yet. There are a couple tables and a sofa for you to settle down in regardless. Some board games are available on the counter to play with. Overall this wouldnt be a bad place to stay and study at but the slush making is a bit loud. Selection is average, greater emphasis on passion fruit and honey options. Would be great to see more diversity with slush and smoothie options considering there was only a taro smoothie amongst the handful of other slushes. DrinksAll drinks came in one size and I would compare it to a large with other boba spots. Passion fruit green tea, half sugar, half ice: still too sweet. I would actually aim for a quarter sugar. Ice level was great however, you could actually notice the reduction. Came with passionfruit seeds and there was a nice tea flavor. Strawberry slush: had slight strawberry flavor. Didnt taste artificial but was bland overall. A bit too much ice incorporated. Would pass. Passionfruit slush: was the better of the two. Had more passionfruit flavor and seeds were crushed throughout. Was a bit too sweet however. Boba: not the greatest nor the worst. Mild sweetness. When included in the slush, the boba was a bit too tough. Probably should cook it a bit longer or at a higher temperature to soften it up. Boba straws are way too short for the cup size. A different length is needed to make drinking comfortable. Also, the straws are kept in a bag on the counter and for sanitation purposes, they shouldnt be unwrapped beforehand and exposed for people to directly grab. Service needs to be improved upon. There was only one person manning both the register and the drinks and it took quite a while to get our drinks. Definitely not on him but on the scheduling. Theres currently a BOGO 50% deal and if you pay with cash, you get an additional 5% off. Drinks are pretty pricey otherwise and were on average around $5.50 with boba. Will probably give this place another shot once things settle down but there could a lot to be improved on. A bit too pricey for the quality but has potential.",

I am happy to confirm that Happy Lemons strawberry green tea has passed my personal taste test! The salted cheese is a plus since it adds another layer of flavor to the drink.

We got the mango matcha (with 50% sugar) and boba and winter melon with fresh milk.

The winter melon with fresh milk was a 10/10 for me, it was creamy with a clear taste of winter melon.

This location? Yes, and yes! The drinks were on point, and this cheese-flavored bubble waffle, MY GOODNESS. Im sad that they dont sell it at all locations because it is a must-try! It has a nice balance of savory and sweet, and is the perfect treat to end a dinner-time meal. As far as location, its not in the best shopping center. The spaces are pretty tight because its packed with businesses. But we went around 6pm on a Monday, so parking was decent. Plus there was barely any line for ordering, so wait time for our order was about 15 mins, including the time it took to make our two bubble waffles.I highly suggest visiting this location for one of their delicious drinks with salted cheese and/or their bubble waffles!",

Super grateful that Lemon Head takes into consideration that people may not want dairy in their drinks (ahem lactose intolerant people or vegans). The guy taking the orders was super helpful in telling me what drinks can be made dairy free. I ordered a strawberry shortcake smoothie with soy milk 30% sweet and an avocado smoothie 50% sweet. Both were good, but def I preferred the 30% sweetness level compared to the 50% sweetness. The strawberry shortcake smoothie def was better than than strawberry frappe at Starbucks when comparing the blend and how if it tastes watery. I feel with the Starbucks drink when you order it dairy free they tend to add more ice to compensate for the lose of dairy. But this strawberry shortcake smoothie from Lemon Head was good! Wasnt as watery as you think and it did taste like strawberry. Definitely going back to try other dairy free drinks. Highly recommend to anyone.

Kind of hard to hear and the menu isnt super intuitive.. like for instance the drink I got was an acronym which meant it is comprised of jelly boba and pudding and No one would know that just reading it off the menu. I asked for no sweetener but they didnt hear me through my mask and the music was super loud the day I went so maybe that could be the reason why.. cant wait to come back!! Oh yeah boba was super soft too. My fianc\u00e9 got the oolong milk tea and half sweetened and I like the quality and taste of that one too.",

I only recently came back because a friend wanted to redeem a reward, but Im glad I did because it looks like theyve improved a lot (or maybe I just had an unusually subpar drink back then). The service is solid and theyre efficient despite only having like two people work during this time. There are also lots of options and everything seems really solid.I usually go for the earl grey fresh milk tea with crystal pearls at half sweet and half ice. I think its always worth it to upgrade to a larger size, and the half sweet is the perfect amount of sweetness in my opinion. Overall will likely come back should I crave a solid milk tea.",

You can adjust how much sugar you want added, but next time Id probably not go half because the drinks already tasted thin in flavor, so all three choices tastes the same and a little watered down. The Brown Sugar was slightly sweeter. I was disappointed with the Earl Grey it didnt have much of the floral flavor I was looking for. The boba pearls were soft and chewy. Getting the drinks in large sizes are under $5 and in decent amounts. And it did took awhile for me to finish my cup during my drive. Upon arrival the employees were friendly.

The pearls were amazing! Perfectly chewy and a little sweet. The jasmine tea in mine had a really good flavor. The downfall was the milk foam. Normally its a lot tangier and just a bolder flavor. This one fell really flat on taste. It tasted just like normal milk that was a little salty. My partner thought his drink was just ok.

Im a fan of Earl Grey so its nice to have it as an option at a boba place, but some people might not like it (due the bergamot oil). The oolong milk tea is also good.Drinks come in two sizes. Medium and Large. Thai tea is a set beverage so the sweetness is not adjustable. Drinks use non-dairy creamer unless it is labeled as fresh milk.I like herbal jelly but find it eventually takes over the taste of your drink midway through so I dont recommend it as a topping. White pearls have a kind of crunchy texture and arent chewy-- I prefer the black pearl boba.I also enjoy the mochi waffle-- warm, chewy, soft and sweet! Its great with vanilla ice cream too.5 stars because the boba and milk tea has been pretty consistent and the drinks made in a timely manner.",

Our order came out decently fast and everyone enjoyed their drinks. We got the: 1) Cajun Fries:-Not super crispy but not overly soggy either. -Very thoroughly seasoned, so I definitely appreciate this, especially after being pretty peckish after a long drive. -We got to choose the sauce for this and it went well with sweet and sour sauce. Definitely enough to share with another person. 2) Rose Blossom: -Very pretty drink with different colors and layers. -Refreshing on a toasty warm day and the drink had a slightly tart citrus flavor that went with the slight sweetness of the rose flavor and toppings. -The drink came with a good amount of topping and I liked the varying differences in texture from the basil seeds, rainbow jelly, and strawberry popping boba. -LOVE that the ice in the drink had basil seeds in it too, thats how you know a place pays attention to detail and is \"fancy\".

If youre looking for a tasty drink thats not necessarily a thirst quencher, we recommend the strawberry cheesecake. Its a really unique drink and they had Graham cracker bits mixed in there, so it did feel like cheesecake. We got it with strawberry heart jelly which was cute, however, they did keep getting stuck in the straw. Maybe boba would have been a better choice. The red velvet cheesecake also tasted like actual red velvet, but it was a bit heavier. We prefer the strawberry cheesecake for a more refreshing drink. The Miami vice which is strawberry Pina colada was also decent and a good choice if you like coconut!

We didnt know about the online/phone order, luckily they also have a QR code that you can scan to place it. We placed our order and waited 20 min! On top of that, our order came out wrong. Unfortunately there was only one guy working and its a contactless pick up (they only drop off orders on a table outside). Its tough times and they were busy, so glad to know theyre staying alive. The drinks were still good though! The boba and lychee toppings were very good and chewy. Hopefully we can come back and have a better experience in the future, post COVID!",

Given we received 20% off by having dined next door, it was almost foolish to not swing by here.I wasnt sure where to set my expectations to be honest since I felt they were just an extension of TGG. Not to mention that boba isnt normally a Korean specialty so I was curious to how they were going to deliver the goods. Sadly I think my expectations were set way too high.I ordered their Strawberry Milk Tea ($4.50) which ended up tasting more-so like strawberry milk that you would find in a carton at H-Mart. I was pretty disappointed because it was nearly impossible to taste the tea. Their boba was okay but I felt a bit bamboozled in what I actually ended up getting compared to my expectations.My friend however got this delicious Taro Milk Tea with added Blueberry syrup which did taste great, since that was what he expected to order. So a good drink and a bad drink means this spot just barely passes. I probably would not come here again just for the boba but since its so close to TGG, I may be convinced otherwise.",

Theyre quick and have an efficient system. You order, grab a pager, grab a seat and then wait for the pager to go off to grab your amazing dessert. Some suggestions to make this dish even better, add mochi/taro balls and sub out the american mangos for the featured ones in the store- the yellow mangos (perhaps theyre not in season now?).",

Kudos goes to the star dessert - oh-man-go (OMG) which is a sampler platter of sorts - sticky rice, mango, ice cream and mango pudding. With such variety, you never get over saturated with one flavor (as you might with a snow ice). The mangos are extremely ripe and sweet. The sticky rice is surgically executed. We were really blown away at this dish. Totally worth the $10. The strawberry cheesecake kakigori had tons of fresh strawberries and cheesecake bites. The house cream sauce is subtle and picturesque.

We got mango ice cream with it and that was pretty decent, a bit on the icier side though. We originally wanted coconut ice cream but they did not have it. The mango, while fresh, was aesthetically pleasing and was great for pictures but annoying to eat. It would have been easier to eat if the mango was skinless. Overall, pretty decent.

Some of these desserts, like the kakigori - a type of shaved, sweetened ice popular in Japan - also happen to be instaworthy.The MNGO kakigori, for example, was a heap of mango flavored ice that, on the surface, wasnt too strongly flavored. Letting it absorb some mango sauce and condensed milk that came on the side allowed it to come to life. Moreover, inside the heap of shaved ice was a decent portion of chopped mango, giving the whole treat a variety of textures and tastes (creamy, sweet, tart) and adding heft to what would otherwise be an easily melt-in-your-mouth, over-all-too-soon dessert.When I stopped by, they had only a skeleton crew working here, so be prepared to wait if it gets busy, as each treat is obviously complex and takes a while to make. Theres plenty of room to spread out inside, but note that, contrary to past reviews, there are no longer charging outlets on top of the tables, but you can try to sit near a wall outlet.By the way, since this is SoCal, it has to be said: food doesnt have to be instaworthy to be satisfying.

Taste - For boba, I always look at the \"tea\" taste factor for milk teas or regular teas, authentic fruit taste in fruit teas, texture of add ins and customization (levels of sweetness, ice level, etc).

Service - Yes, service. At a boba shop. The cashier repeats your order back to you and if youre not sure what you want, he gives you recommendations (For me I wanted my boba milk tea less sweet but was indecisive on the exact level since I had never been to ViVis so he told me that most people who like it less sweet get it at 50%).

If you like your desserts REALLY sweet, this is the place for you! + 1 starsQuality of Food: My friend got Flaming Brown Sugar Boba (half sweet and half ice) - they said that the only option is to ONLY put the brown sugar and not additional sweetness. One drink...and I died. It was so sweet, I needed to add additional sugar to even it out. We also got Oreo creme brule smoothie and that was really sweet too! Price for Food: Average boba price. For the amount of sweetness you are getting, it is worth it :) Location/Ambience: This little shop is located in a small shopping center surrounded by amazing food! It is a great place to chill after eating and if you are craving dessert +1 starsStaff/Service: The cashier who served us was very courteous. They were running low on boba and said that he could give my friend the remaining boba plus another topping for free. He later found out he charged us the wrong size and wanted to refund us. If he had not spoken up, we would have never noticed! Exceptional customer service! +1 stars",

The first time I went, I got both my drinks wrong (I asked twice about subbing non dairy milk because I cant handle it personally and my youngest has an actual milk allergy) I always double and triple check with places and they assured me the first time it was right, and NOT dairy (theres a difference between \"non dairy\" and NO dairy/dairy free No dairy=allergy safe and \"non-dairy\" is NOT usually safe. My first time I drank it and knew instantly it tasted too rich to be the almond milk I was charged extra for. 30 minutes later Im doubled over in pain and riding the waves of stomach pain I dont feel at all since I cut milk completely from my own diet years ago. Thankfully I dont risk anything and didnt give it to my son. Today we tried again as I had a free upgrade texted to me and I asked 3 separate times AND again when I got my drink and specifically asked if they put ANY milk or cream or anything else in it (milk, uncooked liquid milk is the only thing that makes me feel that sick minutes after ingesting it) and he insisted it was almond milkAnd Now Im writing this in between those same stomach cramps yet again, and I barely drank any of it. Their boba is great, so try it if you take places at their face value (meaning no alterations or substitutes) If you have allergies or issues with milk or certain common additives in these teas, find a place that is a bit more conscious because its not an issue to not have alternatives...the world doesnt revolve around MY food issues but it *is* an issue to SAY you can work with an allergy or intolerance and then still use that product. Thats not fair.",

I liked that my total was less than $6 after tip (even though that still seems pricey compared to boba shops where I used to live). I also think the theme of the shop is cute and adds to the overall experience. My only complaint was that it wasnt very sweet, which is kind of my fault. I know I ordered it at 50%, but I usually do this at all boba shops and it comes out the way I like it. Im guessing they just use less sweetener than other shops. Next time I know to go full or 75% sweetness. Also my roommate ordered the matcha with boba at 50% sweetness and enjoyed it.",

It didnt escape our attention that EVERYTHING, from the cup to the straw to the plastic wrapping, was tailored with ViVis logo. We appreciated that touch of personalization.However, the milk tea was a tad bland for our taste. While we could certainly taste the tea flavor, the drink overall didnt pack enough flavor, veering towards the watery side. The grass jelly was smooth, but it floated to the top of our cup which made it hard to enjoy.Prices are typical as you would expect from most boba shops and the business even offers two different cup sizes.

When I walked in, I noticed the really cute interior right off the bat as well as the multiple board games they had for customers to use while enjoying their drinks. The menu had tons of options both fruit tea and milk tea wise. They had a lot of non-traditional flavors (in addition to your regular teas) and if youre someone like me who likes trying new things, then this place is for you. I ordered the flora tea with aloe and my boyfriend got the tiramisu milk tea. Their medium size is the perfect size for a drink in my opinion. Not too small that I feel jipped of my money and not too big that I feel like Im drinking too much sugar. Every time I go to a new boba place I get regular ice and sugar just to see how it normally tastes and if I come back, I adjust accordingly. Their 100% is just right. Its not so sugary that I feel like Im getting diabetes but its not too bitter. I do like tasting the tea a bit more, so next time I will probably go down one sugar level, but for the everyday customer, I think 100 is perfect. Im giving this place 5 stars because it is a smaller not as popular boba place (it wasnt busy on a Saturday night). If I could knock off .25 stars I would just because they didnt have boba when we came in, but thats such a small fault that it didnt change much for me. I opted for aloe and my boyfriend pudding, which were still very delicious in our opinions. Ill definitely be back soon to try more drinks!",

Matcha Cafe Maiko opened their first store in Hawaii (with a goal to provide customers with quality matcha and authentic taste).I visited Matcha Cafe Maiko in August 2021 and tried their Matcha Soft Serve on a Waffle Cone.

Then I went to the one and Escondido and it didnt taste like this one on Convoy. So for this location: Ok so I like green tea flavor not dense real green tea. So we got the puffle dessert with green tea ice cream. The green tea ice cream was literally just as if they picked the leaves, smashed it then put in the ice cream maker, super green color like a street sign green. It tasted bitter and tannic. Like you can taste the branch and the grit of the actual plant. It was not even sweet! You can tell since the green was like a deep green color and not light or creamy color. If this is what real green tea taste like then its not for me. Even the mochi balls were plain too. Weird. The green tea flavor I do like is like somi somi, the green tea ice cream after sushi or green tea mochi. This was just too bitter and strong. It didnt hit your sweet tooth on a hot SD day. Sadly, we threw most of it away ($10) and went to DQ and got a chocolate dip soft serve ice cream. I know, horrible. Fast forward to this past weekend when I tried Maiko in Escondido, the green tea ice cream did not taste like what I had in Convoy. Much better tasting and not bitter. Im gonna conclude its whoever mixed the green tea into the ice cream had a heavy hand that day.",

MAIKO SPECIAL - soft serve with mochi balls, chestnut, matcha cake, adzuki beans, corn flakes, agar jelly, and kuromitsu. You get to pick your soft serve flavor (vanilla, green matcha, strawberry, or a swirl of vanilla+green matcha, or swirl of vanilla+strawberry. Since the dessert itself had other layers of matcha I went for a swirl of the vanilla-strawberry to balance the matcha load and not overkill it (and also because I want to be different!). My thoughts.. it was like a halohalo, bobochacha/buburchacha, bilobilo, che ba mau, Chinese mooncake/teacake... party in the mouth. All kinds of Asian dessert mix in a cup and digging down on through each layer of flavor trying to scoop it all at once with a spoon left no wasted spoon space. Most of my matcha flavor was toward the bottom half... there was a matcha square cake pieces and a little bit of matcha soft serve. Overall, I really enjoyed this cold treat especially during hot summer days. Ill be honest, I came here unexpectedly searching for the Kokonut Dessert Bar only to be lead to \"matcha cafe maiko\". Walked in, saw the menu, and said screw the coconut stuff Im going to try something off the Maiko menu and sold from this point on. Until the next spoonful...JABA APPROVED.",

We were worried about them being too bitter but after trying them, they were a perfect mix of sweetness and being able to taste the matcha! The items are a bit pricier but considering the quality of the matcha compared to other places, I would say that this place was definitely worth it. The cone provided with the matcha ice cream was a bit thin and got soggy easily, but because it was thin it also didnt get as soggy as waffle cones sold at most other ice cream places. I would just say eat it quick because the ice cream melts pretty fast, even with two people sharing one. Regarding the wait time, we went on a Tuesday night at 8 and the 4 or 5 other tables were all full. The wait to order wasnt too long though, only 5 minutes.All things considered, I would definitely recommend this place to other people!",

On the pricey side but It think the reason is the real matcha that they use for the swirl ice cream. Very strong flavor which makes me believe the good quality matcha they use is high end. I have tasted several kind of matcha and Japanese kind is the strongest. Im not a fan of this maiko special. Theres way too much in it. I could be fine with just the matcha swirl, I feel like the cup has too much party goers inside and they just went crazy and drunk. Anyway, would not get this on my next visit here but Ill give them another try.

I came here one evening some time last week and most times I come here, there is either no customers or 1-2. Also, I ONLY ever come here when Im not in the mood to wait at better boba shops. I digress. So I came in and no one was at the counter but their kitchen is visible since they dont have a door and I see two employees that seemed to be washing something. Im a pretty patient and reasonable person, so I wait a minute while I let them do what theyre doing and see if they notice me while I take a glance at the menu just to see options despite the fact that I know what Im ordering. By then theyve noticed me, but no acknowledgement, no greeting, nothing. By then Im irritated because they clearly looked over and saw me. If I have one pet peeve, its poor and lazy customer service. Regardless, I really wanted a drink so I decide to wait another minute and still nothing. I am actually shocked because they have no customers, you think theyd be eager to do business. Im actually so irritated by what happened, I decided if they dont care for or want my business then Ill leave and not give it to them. This ShareTea is in the same lot as Kung Fu Tea and its clear why no one comes here. Ive also had reoccurring issues with past visits of them NEVER having boba and only ever offer mini boba. So with this review and that last visit, that will be my last time ever going to that ShareTea. Note to management: I think a re-training is in order. That is just horrible. That, or do a sweep of your staff and hire those that are proven to have good or at least decent customer service.",

What caught my eye was that the boba here is free with each drink! And theyre boba is actually really good-nice and chewy with just a right amount of sweetness. On a different day, I tried to place a phone order to avoid waiting but they informed me they do not take phone orders but we can order through the app. I got the app and first purchase on the app you currently receive 15 percent off which was awesome. Honestly, the app is making me a regular here lol. Its so easy to order the drinks in there and customize. I love that whenever I go to pick up theres no wait. The last five times Ive been there within the past month (yea I go very often now lol), its been quick since Im pre ordering. The cups are so cute too!I did look at other boba tea shops on Yelp to compare prices to see if the boba free here really is-in case they up the drink price here to include it ya know---welp, it really is free! One of the ice teas I got regular size with boba here was $3.75 whereas many other locations will charge ~$4 for a drink and extra toppings are 60 cents and up. Another reason why Ive been frequent here. Side note-I notice a lot of yelpers mentioned bad slow service. I did order a few times in person but it was never a super long wait and also the workers Ive encountered have always been pleasant.

Lots of drinks to choose from ranging from milk tea, smoothies, milkshakes, coffees, fruit teas, etc. Also, I just found out recently from the cashier in the reopening that boba is free. I wasnt aware of that before, but I usually dont get boba in my drinks because I just get the drink for the drink.

They have this matcha and horchata drink that I like. Its delicious. I think its called...machata...?

The bar has a wide variety of different milk tea flavors and choices along with fruit slushies, coffee, and tub ice cream. I went ahead and chose a large rose milk tea with boba and wow the flavor was immaculate! The beautifully herbal infused aroma flavor was what I expected. The sweetness wasnt overpowering with sugary syrups but was just the true essence of milk and tea with a nice pleasant of flavor from the rose. The color was very appealing that put a nice twist to it. The boba or tapioca pearls where cooked to perfection while when chewing on them they provided a nice snap back and complimented the milk tea.Great boba shop located inside Zion for your one stop shop while sipping and enjoying some delicious and refreshing milk tea.",

Only after that she was finally able to understand. We ordered four different drinks at all but I seriously just wanted to tell her to F off and walk away.

You can get plain egg puffles or fancy loaded diabetes puffles. Theyre more popular for their fancy egg puffles, but their drinks do not disappoint. Their egg puffs are more on the sweet side (yes, even the plain ones) but probably the only place you can get decent ones in SD for now. Food/Drinks: Plain Egg Puffle (4/5): more on the sweet side, but they are able to make the egg puff to be entirely filled! Chocolate Chip Egg puffle (3/5): Pass. Since the plain one is already too sweet for me, the chocolate chip one is way too sweet for me! Jasmine Milk Tea(4/5): strong tea flavor. Yet, also on the sweet side but ask for half sweet and itll be perfect! Vietnamese Iced Coffee (5/5): honestly one of the best Viet Coffees in SD. This slow dripped coffee will keep you wired! ** their boba, grass jelly, and egg pudding is a pass. It tastes like it was more from a can than made in house. Overall, I like this location the best because there is ample amount of parking, and you can go grocery shopping in Zion while waiting for your egg puffs to cook!
