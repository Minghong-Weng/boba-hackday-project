Youre easily able to adjust the ice level, sweetness, and add any add ons. This is so convenient and Ive found my drink comes out a lot faster than other tea shops. Drinks I highly recommend ordering include: - Sunright Fruit Tea: Green tea based drink with orange and passionfruit. If you like fruity drinks, this is a must try!- Jasmine Milk Tea: If youre like me, you like to try the basics when youre at a new spot. Their version of this classic doesnt disappoint. - Taro Milk Tea: Black milk tea drink with fresh taro puree! YUMMMM! Stop by if youre in the area! :)",

Could I suggest some more drinks to try? Our genki sparkling peach tea is new and quite a hit with our guests, if you enjoy matcha then our matcha oolong or strawberry matcha are both delicious and my personal favorite right now is our ceylon milk tea with honey, cheesefoam &amp; oreo bits. Please give any of them a try and let us know what you think.Thanks again and we look forward to serving you soon.",

This location is in Irvine at Diamond Jamboree. I was already in the plaza for lunch, so I was grabbing myself a post-lunch drink to get through the rest of the day. This location has 2 self serve kiosks, credit card or mobile pay only -- no cash. It was a fairly simple process for me, but I can see how this can be discouraging to someone who is not comfortable with technology... like my parents. This business is definitely trying to optimize their staff to making drinks only and not worrying about helping the customer. All of the drinks are one size. My go to drink is the Strawberry Frosty ($5.75) 70% sweet. It has a nice fresh strawberry fruit taste with a nice creaminess. Very refreshing. Highly recommended if you like strawberries. The location seemed to be understaffed or just backordered. The drinks took a really long time to prepare. I super felt bad for the staff as they apologized to each person, sorry for the wait. Ouch. Not their fault they are understaffed. That should be managements issue to deal with. I would only come here if there is no visible line and I am already in the plaza. Otherwise it would be too much of a hassle.",

We removed our cashier when covid started and moved ordering to our kiosks and online system, our customers seem to love it so we kept it going, I think the majority of our guests prefer self ordering drinks but we can also take orders for anyone whom is not comfortable with the technology. We were not understaffed today but unfortunately did have a few very large orders, one for 24 drinks that set us behind so we apologize that you had to wait longer than usual, we try our best to get all orders out within 10 minutes but sometimes we do get slammed, especially on warm weekends. We hope you will come by again next time you are in the area, if you enjoy our strawberry frostie may I suggest trying our fresh mango or peach frostie then adding cheesefoam, they are also quite refreshingly delicious.Thanks again.",

Their Jasmine Green Milk Tea really hits the spot. The only adjustment that I would make the next time I come to this boba show is to get 75% with less ice. The one I got was 100% sweet with less ice and it was still a little too sweet for me even though it did hit the spot. I would definitely recommend ordering the drink(s) using their Kiosk.",

The quality of ingredients and tea is top notch, and every drink is made with fresh ingredients. You get a pretty prominent tea taste in the drinks, which is a good sign that they arent diluting their tea with water! The brown sugar boba is also so soft yet bouncy, and perfectly sweet!

Perhaps one with more refined tastebuds will appreciate this drink more! I ordered it thinking it would be like their popular boba fresh milk series but with tea flavor...? The best way to describe it is probably like a cross between very sweet powdered milk and curdled milk. Not my cup of tea...or rather, milk.The brown sugar boba that day was also not their best. Clumpy and watered down, like what happens when its been sitting out for too long and starts coagulating.I also had a sip of their famous Sunright Fruit Tea ($4.95) and was a little underwhelmed. It was refreshing but nothing special.Ordered online and our drinks were ready ahead of time so that tipped this review in their favor. Very efficient store by the looks of it from the whole ten seconds I was in there when picking up the drinks.Personally I will be sticking to the boba fresh milk, taro flavor, which is so creamy and addicting!Thanks for reading! ^-^",

You can customize the drinks to the level of ice, sweetness, and toppings. I got the cream pudding milk tea with honey Boba added to my drink. Along with that I got the brown sugar milk tea with Boba as well. In my opinion, the cream pudding milk tea was a little bit better. It had a more flavorful aftertaste that was very nice since Ceylon tea is whats used for it. They seem to have a Lotta nice drinks, definitely worth trying out.",

Glad you enjoyed your jasmine milk tea and sunright fruit tea. If you are looking for something more special may I recommend trying the oolong brulee oat latte which is perfect with brown sugar boba, the mango milk tea with honey boba, the strawberry matcha latte, the oreo brulee boba milk and our sunright boba milk tea with cheesefoam. Hopefully one of these drinks will earn us that 5th star.Thanks again and we hope you visit us again soon.",

That is how much I love milk tea! It is so refreshing and addictive. I like the idea of ordering at a kiosk so that way you can adjust it just the way you like. I cam on a busy sunday afternoon and there was a small line but it seemed to move quickly and there were several patrons waiting for their drinks both inside and outside. I opted for the sunright signature milk tea which was absolutely the right call. it comes with brown sugar and syrup with light boba-- i didnt modify the boba, they just dont put alot but you can pay extra for more. While they recommend 100% sweetness, i honestly wouldnt order more than 50% since the whole drink together was just perfectly sweet.",

Usually other places honey boba are dark color which taste more like honey with brown sugar mixed. But at sunright the boba is clear color. Taste like honey only. Which compliment their sunright fruit tea very well. In fact Im guessing this honey boba probably compliment all the fruit drinks they have because is light and wont make the refreshing fruit drinks too sweet or heavy. Great job sunright!

This time definitely taste better. The fresh watermelon was blended I believe because you can see from the top part of the drink. The jasmine tea jelly fit right in. I got it at 50% sweetness but I think it can even go 25% sweetness since the watermelon itself is fresh and in season and has its own sweetness as it is. Definitely no salt inside this time.

The storefront is a little tucked away, but theres plenty of parking.The interior has a minimalist design and there was a giant table where one patron was doing work. I was sort of surprised to see anyone doing work there because the store has a pretty loud echo. The floor was also like solid concrete so I felt like I caused a ruckus just stomping in and out, but the customer working on his laptop didnt seem to care.There wasnt much of a line and the guy helping me out was friendly. My drink didnt take too long to make and was ready a few minutes after ordering. Their drinks are a bit on the pricier side, but I will 100% be coming back here because I love floral boba drinks and they excel at making it. I got the Jasmine Green Tea latte 50% sweet with boba. If youre a fan of floral boba drinks or a fan of drinks with a strong tea flavor, this is your new boba spot. I absolutely love the freshness, creaminess, and slight bitterness of the jasmine green tea paired with the sweeter, chewy boba. The tea really does taste like its good quality and is very distinct in both tea and floral flavoring. At 50% sweet, the drink is more comparable to 25% at other places so keep that in mind if you have a bigger sweet tooth. Word of caution: if youre super sensitive to caffeine like I am, drink it earlier in the day because the tea is strong so you might be feeling extra energetic from it for awhile.I followed the instructions of shaking the drink 8 times and it does do a pretty gradient as all the layers mix together. Drink packaging is really pretty too, but I wouldnt mind a less aesthetic drink for slightly cheaper prices. Still, I did enjoy it throughly and will be back the next time Im craving boba in Irvine.",

Trust me when I say this because Ive tried many tea houses and Ive compared enough to know which one is a good matcha and which one is not. Pairing the drink with boba will bring it to the next level. Absolutely must order here! - chocolate black tea latte: pretty good too. This time I ordered with oat milk and less milk.

The boba had a nice chewy and firm texture, along with a strong honey taste. The drink is on the pricier side ($5.43 + $0.56 for boba), but they dont charge for soy or oat milk alternatives! Online ordering took about 20 min, and it was on time. The store was clean and had an interesting table with humps. I would come back to get this drink, or try their other drinks! 10/10",

Most of the boba places Ive been to had mild tea flavours but this drink has the perfect milk to tea portion. Also its rare to find Mountain Rock Tea in general so its worth a try!

They are off Harvard and Main, in the same plaza as Ralph and Chase, right next to the Jamba Juice. This location seems to still be figuring things out... On the day of my visit it was STEAMING HOT and so uncomfortable. I almost contemplated walking out. They were also unbearably slow making the drinks after they were ordered. I ordered the same thing I got at their Tustin location in the past. I had the iced Cheese Cap Jasmine Green Tea ($5.10) - Perfect Sweet, which is 70 % sweet. This is one of their popular drinks, as indicated with a crown next to it on the menu.The foam ratio was a lot greater than when I got the same drink in Tustin. So even when I took the advice to tilt my drink at a 45 degree angle, all I got was foam, and no tea. I ended up just shaking it up so I can taste all the ingredients. I think whoever made it just overdid it on the foam and messed up the ratios. Hopefully they get their staff trained better and Id be more than happy to come back and bump up their rating once they have it all figured out with this location.",

They have an artsy long table thats more for decor than practicality, and the environment didnt have that same intimate warmth of a tea house that the Tustin location has. We ordered the Mountain Rock cheese foam and sesame cheese foam and both drinks were solid. Mountain Rock is one of their popular drinks and is an oolong type drink. Wish the tea flavor came through a little more like it does at the Tustin location. Alas all locations are not created equal. Got both at 50% sweet and that was perfect.

Have to say Im glad I did because any issues with uncooked boba has been resolved. The quantity of boba is still really small compared to other boba shops so Ive fixed that by simply ordering TRIPLE the amount rather than my usual double boba. Tea is flavorful and Ive even gotten used to it tasting more watered down from fresh milk. Quality has been pretty consistent and reliable so Im glad they worked out the kinks from their soft opening. Service is always fast and friendly and prices are reasonable. Definitely recommend this place if youre looking for a more natural boba tea with strong tea flavor. Got the strawberry treasure for my kid and it was really tasty. More of a strawberry milk with bits of fresh strawberries and aloe at the bottom. Mountain rock tea latte is my go to because I love roasted oolong milk tea. The boba is smaller compared to most places so dont be surprised because Im giving you the heads up. Its still good though just make sure to order double boba because they really dont give much.",

For me personally, the strong flavor of the base tea was awesome but I really am not a fan of fresh milk in my milk teas. Its just too watered down and not very rich or creamy even though I know its better for you. For that reason, Id give the milk tea a 3 stars but I think thats a matter of personal preference. I thought 25% sweetness was just the perfect amount of sweetness and was just lightly sweetened so you can still taste the tea flavor. My biggest complaint would be the amount of boba. I ordered double and it felt like it was a single serving. Decided to give this place another try today since they are officially open and I have to say again, I just wasnt impressed. Biggest complaint is the small amount of boba. When I order double and pay extra, it shouldnt be the same amount as just a single serving at most places. Also, part of the bobas this time werent cooked through and were hard in the middle. THIS IS THE WORST. I hate when boba is half cooked. Dont see myself coming back here again.

Set my mood to taste fresh tea leaf in my drinks!I like the top 3 drinks the most for its refreshing taste. The drink size is big too! I dont like the blueberry drink that much compared to the others. Maybe its just only me because it quite depends on your personal preference when it comes to texture. The flavor is okay for me only the texture is not for me. I love the creamy cheese foam a lot! They currently sell matcha powder and more tea drinking tools coming in the future to bring the fullest tea drinking experience. Overall, quick service and healthy drinks.

They dont mess with their teas - the flavor is strong but not overpowering and the cheese foam gave the drink a slight hint of saltiness which I love. I didnt drink straight from the cup however like the instructions say on the lid, as I dont like too much cheese foam with each sip. Im someone who takes hours to finish boba or tea, but I literally finished this drink in 10 minutes. Im not kidding when I say this drink put this shop on the same tier as Omomo - although Ill have to try a couple more drinks from this place before I make a concrete decision ;)",

Before, I could only get it if I just so happened to be around their Tustin location. The interior is clean and crisp. However, the huge white table they have is super wonky and mimics those topography model maps, if one was modelling an area with really bulbous mountains. I wonder how people will be able to have a distraction-less conversation if half of their body is covered by a big hump or if they will even be able to set their boba drink down. It was kind of hilarious to see chairs tucked in under the table, because there is no way a person would be able to get any work done or willingly sit there. Anyways, interior design things aside, HNTea is solid and always delivers. I always flit back and forth between the Mountain Rock Tea Latte and the Golden Black Tea latte. The Mountain Rock tea boasts a rich, roasty taste thats perfect for oolong tea lovers. The Golden Black Tea is reminiscent of a HK milk tea. Both are great choices for a person who loves black milk tea. Ive tried their Black Sesame Cheese Cap and while the cheese was great, the black sesame was a little lacking because it ended up tasting like watery milk, completely void of that toasty, nutty black sesame flavor I wanted. Ive always wanted to try their matcha drinks, but Im always hesitant because of the steep price.But, HNTea is a good choice for high quality milk tea, so dont be thrown off by some high prices. And, expect a pretty lengthy wait for your drinks.",

I honestly didnt even want my drink at this point, but the Golden Black Tea Latte was pretty good. It had a strong tea flavor and was a high quality milk tea! Although my drink was flavorful, I was disappointed that they ran out of the tea and boba I wanted especially because I arrived an hour before closing.

Other items I recommend here are the Premium Matcha Soy Latte and Strawberry Jasmine Green Tea. This location allows phone orders so we typically phone in our orders so we dont have to wait!

I do know that you can lower the sweetness level, and Ill probably do that next time, but at its full sweetness, it tastes just like every other tea spot in the OC at a price point that is a little higher than average (though crushed ice and fresh fruit is alot better than syrup and machined ice). Nothing discerning or particular about the tea currently, but I hope that will change with my next visit.Id say definitely worth a try.

Im not in the total know of BTS besides really enjoying their music so I felt out of my typical realm which was really awesome. Everyone seemed so nice, followed mask guidelines, and we had a great experience (5 star worthy)Second time there, the lady at the counter seemed extremely annoyed and had some attitude when we gave our order. Total the opposite of what we experienced before. This time you can see their total decor as the tables and chairs were back in place. Super cute, very Instagram-friendly shop. This experience was meh and we just wanted to not bother the lady at the cash register with our business (2 stars worthy)The dirty creme brulee has been my go-to. However, 100% sweetness is way too sweet. 75% was also too sweet for my friend. Its a good drink, but its nothing out of this world. If you go, try the dirty creme brulee boba, but adjust it to your sweetness and take your photos. Unfortunately, Feng Cha wont be on my go-to list for boba unless someone else wants to try it out.",

My past visits I had the chance to try the very popular Strawberry Overload and the Oolong Milk Tea with Cheese Foam and compared to other boba spots, these drinks were not particularly special - not the tea, the flavors, nor the cheese foam. And for a price tag of about $5.50 (large size), I would expect them to blow me away - that aint cheap!The good thing is that they nail the sweetness level as at 50% they were spot on. The not so great thing is during my past visit, they only had a large size available and were out of a number of teas and ingredients. They definitely have some growing pains to still improve upon, but also, its been long past their grand opening stage so I would think they would have been gotten things like this in order by now!",

Im not sure if it was because the music was too loud or if she was a new employee and really anxious, but she couldnt run the register without assistance. The entire experience was frustrating.After taking our order, I watched her slide to the hand off station and she proceeded to combine different drink orders together. I almost said something until an employee in a gray shirt directed her to actually read the labels to see the order number as well as the customer name to make sure that customers would get their proper drinks. Had not been for the other employee, people would have walked away with incorrect drink orders. I had to make sure that my drinks were correct. She bagged mine up with someone elses.The thing that gets me the most and I hope that your company educates your employees on, is your cleanliness and overall food health and safety.You have a sign that says all of your staff are fully vaccinated, and I can respect your companys willingness to promote cleanliness and health. Yet, that employee in the black shirt proceeded to touch every single cups interior on the prep line with her fingers immediately after handling money and working on the register. Neither did she sanitize nor wash her hands. Hold the cups from the outside. Never touch the inside of a customers cup.Please make sure you have alignment in your health and safety procedures and your staffs execution of your safety food protocols.",

Nothing to be mad at, just not aesthetically pleasing when mixed.Tonight I decided to try the oolong with cheese foam and I was sooo dissapointed. I knew it might be chunky, considering the sea cream was chunky, so that wasnt a problem. I mixed the drink properly by holding it upside down and vigorously twisting and shaking (as I was taught being a former boba barista). When I took a sip, I got a peice of crusty chunky cheese foam and it wasnt a silky melt-in-your mouth consistency :( it was a hard peice that wouldnt even break in between my fingers. Id have to chew the damn thing. I know cheese foam is usually made with cream cheese, which means the cream cheese must have been sitting out to get that crusty peice in there! Yuk! I couldnt even finish my drink after that. The yogurt series is interesting and worth trying. Its a little too sweet though especially strawberry and lychee yogurt tea!",

Unlike Ding Tea Tustin where I have to regularly wait 20 min for my drink, they are super efficient at the Irvine location! Employees make your drink with haste and consistently too. The best boba shops operate with efficiency, consistency, and attentiveness. Ding Tea Irvine checks all those boxes! Of the many times Ive been at this location Ive never encountered a long line, most is 3 parties deep. And even then my drink comes out in 2 min. Thank you Ding Tea Irvine for being the standard for how boba shops should operate! Employees are super friendly and to the point, no excessive conversations or attitude. I used to be a strictly tea tea milk tea girl, but after trying out the winter melon milk tea I fell in love! Normal winter melon (non-milk) tea is usually too sweet and after drinking a few sips I dont want anymore. But the milk tea is totally different! Im thinking the milk component makes it less sweet and intense. Unfortunately the lowest sugar level is 30% which is still quite sweet but once the ice melts its perfect.

After seeing the ~recently trending~ Oreo Brulee option that lots of other boba places have recently started offering, I decided to finally give it a try - and let me tell you, I was pleasantly surprised by how delicious it was. It is a sweeter drink, but on a hot day, it was perfectly refreshing and similar to an Oreo McFlurry, but with less guilt (I think?) Their boba was also super fresh and chewy - and I usually never get boba - but it was definitely an enjoyable addition. Hubby ordered the (I think) the Strawberry Crush for a lighter option with 50% sweetness. Unfortunately, it ended up not being sweet enough for him, but was otherwise also very refreshing and somewhat reminiscent of Starbucks old Strawberry Water option. Drinks are a little pricey, but still priced alongside most boba shops these days, so Im sure thats pretty standard. All in all, definitely a great place with lots of options and a make your own options which I hope to try out next time!",

Part of the second or third wave of food halls following the initial success of the Anaheim Packing House, I used to look forward to dropping by for some fried goodies from The Kroft, a cookie milk shooter from The Dirty Cookie, and some fancy milk tea from Milk Box. None of those places are around anymore and the whole space seems pretty dead... another victim of COVID-19.As I walked the empty hallways, reminiscing of casual dining days long past, I stumbled onto Leaf N Cream. While boba joints remain as plentiful in OC as poke bowl places once were, a lot of places are just franchise locations of familiar names who rely on a consistent mix of powders and sugars to produce their addictive drinks. What caught my eye for Leaf N Cream is that they seem to put a lot of effort into making layered drinks: their Ms. Strawberry, Mr. Mango, Matcha Gotcha, Oreo Creme Brulee and Swirl Thai all look amazing!Ive been on a brown sugar milk tea kick for a bit so I ordered their Dirty Milk Latte: rich brown sugar with fresh milk. The weathers too hot for boba so I got it without and asked for light ice... a sweet and refreshing drink for the dog days of Summer.Make sure you mix your drink with a straw before you imbibe, otherwise you might get a mouthful of cream! Will definitely be back to try all the other drinks!",

Generally, half sweet with light boba. I like that fat free milk is used. Creamer makes my stomach unhappy. The drinks will lack that sort of thick taste because theres no creamer. It can taste like its been water down but its because fat free milk is used. Iactually prefer the lack of creamer as it tends to border syrupy or leaves a milk film feeling on my tongue. Boba is the right amount of chewy and stays consistent. There are places with boba that starts out super chewy but then hardens quite quickly. which generally is a sign that the drink was made poorly. In order for boba to stay soft, the ice is added last. You should find the drink cool not ice cold. This might be another reason that adds to the water down taste because it may feel like room temperature on a hot day. I think the price is reasonable and budget friendly. I seem to notice that people who complain about the $5 per drink price also complains about the service. The staff does laze around but if they are done with their task, I dont see a problem. I mean what would you do in that situation?

TLDR; our drinks were really watered down despite asking for regular sweetness and the boba had a really slimy consistency and no flavor (we heard the servers remark whether or not they need to make more boba, so maybe we just got the short end of the stick and got some of the boba that was sitting around).

There arent a lot of places that have this on their menu, so I was pretty excited to get it again. But this location didnt have just a plain hojicha milk tea, it only has the black sugar hojicha milk tea. I asked if I could just get that without the black sugar. The boba-rista said no, they cant make adjustments cuz it was a special menu item. I didnt understand this because the black sugar hojicha was under a section on their menu that actually says \"BUILD YOUR OWN DRINK.\" How do I do that if I cant make adjustments?Then I asked if they make drinks hot, and she said yes. So I tried to order a hot dirty horchata. Oh, that one doesnt come hot. So I ended up ordering a hot jasmine milk tea, no sugar, with boba.

They seemed to have a decent business model from what I could see, and I was curious to give them a try if I was near a location. They took over the former cafe/restaurant space next to 2nd Street Japan and turned it into a cute walk-up cafe with some seating under the covered area. The space is modern and clean - perfect to sit or stand under on a warm, sunny day. You walk up to the counter to order your drink and it will come out at the Pick-up window to the left of the register. They do have alternative milk options for those who are dairy-free or lactose intolerant. (Oat milk and almond milk)The gal who waited on me was quick and pleasant. I ordered their black milk tea in a 16 Oz with half sweetness, oat milk, and boba. Prices were comparable to other bubble tea places Ive gone to. At this time they seem to be doing card only transactions. Drink took only 2 minutes tops. They encouraged me to let them know if I needed adjustments. I had to run more errands so I took my cup to go and enjoyed it in the car. Was glad I did 50% sweetness and a 16oz because the boba was very sweet. There were floral notes in their black tea, which was a bit off putting at times and didnt balance well with the other components of the drink. Boba was a good consistency but I did have to toss the rest because it got a little too sweet. Eventually, my stomach didnt care for the drink and I felt a bit nauseous for about an hour after I finished the drink. While the team was nice, the location was cute, and they were trying to make a conscious effort by offering compostable straws, I dont think Ill be coming back here again. Something in their tea didnt sit well with me and I would rather spend my money on a place where I like the tea flavor and the balance of ingredients.",

They provide a very similar menu to the Snow Monster location that theyve replaced, instead of ice cream they have gelato. Compared to Snow Monster though they have WAY more drink options, ranging from various fruit teas to even a Nutella Milk Tea, which I ended up trying. My girlfriend tried the Black Sugar Milk Tea.Let me start off by saying the customer service was why I refuse to give 4 stars. As a new shop, you would think that making customers feel welcome is a priority. The lady at the counter had an absolutely cold demeanor; from the moment we walked in there was no hello or any form of response, just stared at us the entire time without a single word. After we paid and said thanks, she immediately walked off to make our drinks. We figured she mightve not heard us, but when we did receive our drinks, we said thanks again only to receive another blank stare in response. So again not so friendly service. It seemed like she really didnt care to be there, and when we left we caught her silently staring at us, presumably waiting for us to be gone so she could go back to talking with a coworker. Now in contrast to the service, the drinks are pretty good! The richness of the black sugar actually complimented the tea very well, which was also pretty good quality. At 100% sweetness it was a bit too sweet, would maybe go for 50% so the sugar wouldnt overwhelm the tea flavor as much. Still a pretty good balance. As for the Nutella Milk Tea, if youve had Tea Bricks Nutella Shake and liked it youd definitely like this. It tastes exactly like youd imagine. They actually blend the Nutella into the milk tea, so while they layer the cup with Nutella (kinda like Omomos matcha drinks) its actually also infused with the tea. I liked it, but its definitely for those with more of a sweet tooth. Both drinks ended up to be around $6, which is nice. So good drinks but poor customer service. Also we sampled the gelato and it was okay.",

It had real lime, but the passion fruit was clearly a syrup. Fruit syrups are one of my pet peeves! Still, it didnt make the drink inedible - just too desert-like for my tastes. The pearls though... why Im taking off two stars. It was so hard, clearly old, and the honey coating added a sickening flavor to my drink. When I avoided the pearls, my drink tasted so much better. I will still return to try their other drinks, but maybe with no pearls. Incorrectly cooked or old pearls make me seriously ill.",

At the store, you place your order through a kiosk to minimize contact with the employees. Plenty of hand sanitizer available so also good to know this place is COVID-conscious! Their employees were super friendly and brought a lot of energy to the place. As for the drink, I ordered the honey jasmine milk tea with boba. I couldnt really taste the honey, but still really enjoyed the drink. However, their boba consistency was perfect. So chewy! Would definitely come back next time to try their other drinks.",

I got the matcha drink, and I thought it was excellent, and my family also said that their drinks were amazing. The customer service was very prompt. Because of COVID, you had to order on a screen, and they would text you when your order was ready. Loved it!",

The biggest problem I thought were the drinks being really sweet for their sugar level, not to mention that it tastes a bit too much like watered down corn syrup.Came in the evening and the place was sorta packed with Tik-Tokers and teens, that sort of vibe. You order through a touchpad, and it showed pics of all the drinks which was nice. Prices are average and what youd expect from 2nd tier boba (the level below premium boba shops). As for the selection, they had a menu that sorta changes, like when I looked to see if they had matcha tea, the pics on Yelp shown that they have it, while when I went, it wasnt listed. Anyways, I went with the house milk tea with early grey, boba, and cheese foam. Ordering and getting the drink was contactless and quick, in spite of the small crowd. Just FYI, social distancing wasnt really enforced. Everyone looked like teens so I wasnt too surprised. As for the house tea, it was so-so. Definitely on the sweet side even at 25%, although the boba was fine. Also, I think its about the same watery level as ding tea or gong cha, nothing bad but nothing great either, maybe a little worse than those two as well as the closest comparison I can think of. Also the fructose syrup has a weird aftertaste that I cant pinpoint but I think its the cause of it being sooooo sweet. For a fairly crowded boba spot this place is a bit disappointing.",

One drink cost me over $8 and the other $7. What I got were two overly sweet drinks that tasted completely powder-based. The crystal boba I got was only enough to cover one layer of the bottom of the cup. Im disappointed in these drinks especially at these price points for it to just taste like powder.",

This drink came out and the color looked nothing like a \"taro milk tea.\" I asked the lady work there \"are you sure this is taro milk tea?\" because the color was so dark, obviously a cacao milk tea or something chocolate. She said yes our taro looks like that. I have the drink today and I was right, its not taro milk tea. It would be okay if the lady admitted its not taro then we will be happy to take this instead of the drink we ordered, but this case she lied so definitely not gonna come back!!",

The boba we got was supposed to be brown sugar milk tea, like tiger sugar boba... well its so disappointing because its just milk with boba nothing else! Paid over 5 dollars for milk... the boba was too sweet, not chewy anymore and it taste just like milk with sugar. Cheaper to buy a gallon... the place is also looking dirty, the lady that is making our drink kept dropping the ice on the countertop thankFully she did not put it back on my drink coz I would say something. Its weird that they take orders from the iPad, theres only one iPad so you kinda have to wait in line and people take their time to browse around... will NEVER go back here sorry!",

I ordered the Lavender Milk Tea which was okay, the lavender taste was very mild but what I was disappointed most about was the boba. Some of the tapioca balls were clustered and had like a few hard chunks which was off-putting...the boba also didnt have much of a flavor which may not matter to some people but after trying honey-soaked boba at other boba shops, it was underwhelming. The Lavender Milk Tea comes topped off with a sweet cream foam and tiny lavender bits which I would say was probably the best part about the whole drink. Overall, I wasnt crazy about the drink and probably wont be back, however, staff was nice and welcoming.",
